Readme is on the todo list...

For now only the changes are listed:
- Install mflowgen as submodule and virtual enviroment using Make
	
    Change mflowgen repository by setting
	- MFLOWGEN_REPO url and MFLOWGEN_BRANCH
	- MFLOWGEN_NAME can also be changed
	- If mflowgen is already installed on the disk you can also change MFLOWGEN_ROOT, default directory is mflowgen/mflowgen

- Installing ADK using Make
	
    Change SKY130 ADK repository by settings
	- SKY_ADK_REPO ur and SKY_ADK_BRANCH
	- If the ADK is already installed on the disk you can also change SKY_ADK_PATH, default directory is mflowgen/SKY130_ADK

-  [Automate the ADK standard view installation](https://github.com/heavySea/skywater-130nm-adk)
	- Copy more files from the open-pdk generated files
	- Newly generated files for Synopsys and Cadence tools are copied into the PDK for reuse

- main Makefile includes targets to build the design with mflowgen
	- targets are generated from directory names in mflowgen/flows
	- builds are done under mflowgen/build_*
- Works now until Synthesis
- PnR with Innovus started
	- currently trying to use .def file as initial floorplan from https://github.com/lnis-uofu/SOFA
